# Chernobyl nuclear disaster

## The accident
**April 26, 1986:**
The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the No. 4 reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR in the Soviet Union.

At 01:23:04 a.m. the test began, then 36 second later at 01:23:40 the "scram" *explain scram* button was pressed. We only know the final reading. Reactor No. 4 designed to operate at 3200 mW went beyond 33,000 mW. At 01:23:45 the reactor explodes.,
pressure builds in the reactor No. 4. This causes an explosion that lifts a 1,000-ton lid that covers volatile fuel elements. Radiation is immediately released into the air.

Thirty separate fires develop. An alarm goes off at a local fire station.

At 1.45 a.m. firefighters arrive. They know nothing about radiation and aren’t wearing any protective clothing. Driver Grigory Khmel later recalls: "We saw graphite lying everywhere. I kicked a bit of it. Another fireman picked up a piece and said 'hot.' Neither of us had any idea of radiation. My colleagues Kolya, Pravik and others all went up the ladder of the reactor. I never saw them again."

At 5 a.m. reactor No. 3 is shut down. Reactors No. 1 and 2 are stopped about 24 hours later.

## Days after the accident 
**April 28, 1986:**
The Soviet Union publicly admits for the first time that an accident happened but gives few details.

An alarm goes off at a Swedish nuclear plant after the soles of shoes worn by a nuclear safety engineer there test positive for radioactivity. The radiation is traced to Chernobyl.


## Why did it happen?

## Who is responsible?

## The consequences
Gorbachev, in a 2006 memoir, says "Chernobyl was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union."

There is a diffrence improvising a presetnation at school and improvising controling a nulcear reactor.
