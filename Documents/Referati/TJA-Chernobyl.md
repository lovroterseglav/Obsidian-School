# Chernobyl nuclear disaster

## The accident
**April 26, 1986:**
The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the No. 4 reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR in the Soviet Union.

At 01:23:04 a.m. the test began *explain test*, then 36 second later at 01:23:40 the "scram" *explain scram* button was pressed. We only know the final reading. Reactor No. 4 designed to operate at 3200 MW went beyond 33,000 MW we can only estimate to how fair it went. During this time pressure builds in the reactor No. 4. At 01:23:45 the reactor exploded. This causes an explosion that lifts a 1,000-ton lid and split open the roof.

Multiple separate fires develop. An alarm goes off at a local fire station.
The core would stop burning on May 10th.

At twenty minutes later firefighters arrive. They know nothing about radiation and aren’t wearing any protective clothing. Driver Grigory Khmel later recalls: "We saw graphite lying everywhere. I kicked a bit of it. Another fireman picked up a piece and said 'hot.' Neither of us had any idea of radiation. My colleagues Kolya, Pravik and others all went up the ladder of the reactor. I never saw them again."

At 5 a.m. reactor No. 3 is shut down. Reactors No. 1 and 2 are stopped about a day later.

## Days after the accident 
The Soviet Union publicly admits for the first time that an accident happened but gives few details.

An alarm goes off at a Swedish nuclear plant after the soles of shoes worn by a nuclear safety engineer there test positive for radioactivity. The radiation is traced to Chernobyl.

It was thought by some that the core fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping more than 5,000 tonnes (11 million pounds) of sand, lead, clay, and [neutron-absorbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_capture "Neutron capture") [boron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron "Boron") onto the burning reactor. It is now known that virtually none of these materials reached the core.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#cite_note-BBCContaining-51) Historians estimate that about 600 Soviet pilots risked dangerous levels of radiation to fly the thousands of flights needed to cover reactor No. 4 in this attempt to seal off radiation.


## Why did it happen?

## Who is responsible?

## The consequences
Gorbachev, in a 2006 memoir, says "The Chernobyl meltdown was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union."

# Killer lines
There is a diffrence improvising a presetnation at school and improvising controling a nulcear reactor.

A catastrophe is a chain of unfortunate events.
